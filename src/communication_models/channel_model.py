CSI Data Generator for OFDMA System with Massive MIMO
======================================================

This file defines a `CSIDataGenerator` class, which models the Channel State Information (CSI) for an
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system with a Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(MIMO) setup. This class simulates channel gain matrices under an urban macro scenario with non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) conditions, using parameters such as transmit and receive antennas, frequency, clusters, and paths.

The channel gain magnitude follows a Rayleigh distribution, and the phase is modeled using a uniform
distribution. This setup reflects multipath scattering in dense urban environments without a direct line of sight.

Classes:
--------
	- CSIDataGenerator: Generates the CSI matrix for a given number of time instances and subcarrier frequencies,
	  accounting for small-scale fading (Rayleigh and uniform distributions) and large-scale fading (path loss and shadowing).

Usage:
------
	csi_generator = CSIDataGenerator(Nt=64, Nr=4, f_c=5e9, N_clusters=5, L_path=3)
	csi_data = csi_generator.generate_CSI_data(timestamps, subcarriers)

Dependencies:
-------------
	- numpy: For mathematical operations and generating random variables.
	- pandas: For structuring the generated CSI data in a DataFrame.

	CSIDataGenerator Class
	=======================

	This class generates Channel State Information (CSI) data matrices for a massive MIMO setup
	within an OFDMA system. The class supports a user-specified number of transmit and receive antennas,
	frequency, clusters, and paths. The CSI matrices are created for each time instance and subcarrier,
	modeling both small-scale and large-scale fading.

	Attributes:
	-----------
		- Nt (int): Number of transmit antennas.
		- Nr (int): Number of receive antennas.
		- f_c (float): Carrier frequency in Hz.
		- N_clusters (int): Number of multipath clusters.
		- L_path (int): Number of paths per cluster.
		- shadowing_std_dev (float): Standard deviation of shadowing for large-scale fading.

	Methods:
	--------
		- generate_channel_gain(): Generates a complex channel gain matrix for the small-scale fading model.
		- path_loss(d): Computes the path loss in dB based on an empirical formula for an NLOS urban macro environment.
		- large_scale_fading(d): Computes the large-scale fading (path loss + shadowing) for given distances.
		- generate_CSI_data(timestamps, subcarriers): Generates the CSI data matrices over time instances and subcarriers.
